# Rockbuster SQL Project

**Data analysis project using SQL to explore Rockbuster Stealth’s customer and revenue data.**  
Completed as part of the *CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program*.

## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that previously operated physical stores worldwide. Facing increasing competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster plans to launch an online video rental service.  
As a data analyst in the Business Intelligence (BI) team, I was tasked with using SQL to analyze Rockbuster’s customer and sales data to help guide the company’s 2020 strategy.

## Objectives
The Rockbuster management team wanted insights on:
- Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue?
- What was the average rental duration for all films?
- Which countries are Rockbuster’s customers based in?
- Where are high lifetime value customers located?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

These insights were used to guide Rockbuster’s online strategy and identify opportunities for international growth.
